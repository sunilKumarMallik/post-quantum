              We have been active in post-quantum cyber security since 2009 and
              consulted across a range of industries. More recently, our
              portfolio of quantum-safe products have been deployed across a
              number of industries in some of the first examples of real-world
              post-quantum encryption.
              <br /> With end-user and server-side products for identity,
              transmission and encryption we can work with you to solve a wide
              range of cyber security problems. Our technology can be delivered
              flexibly as part of third-party solutions and as off-the-shelf
              products.

              <p>
                Banks and financial institutions are preparing for a
                quantum-safe future by auditing existing infrastructure to
                identify traditional cryptography that will need to be upgraded.
                These multi-year programmes are some of the largest since Y2K in
                the late 1990â€™s. As custodians of client funds and sensitive
                information about asset ownership financial institutions are
                taking a proactive approach to post quantum cyber security. We
                are a product of the Barclays TechStars accelerator and our CEO
                is a former head of credit risk at JP Morgan giving us an
                intimate understanding of the cyber security challenges banks
                face. We have consulted with institutions to support
                post-quantum migration planning and our technology is in use
                across the industry at firms like Hitachi Capital.
